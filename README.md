### üí≠INSPIRATION
<br>~ Our college AOT does not have its own fees payment portal. Therefore , many students and parents have to travel a certain distance and line up in queues for submission of College fees.Our team TECH WIZARD has taken the initiative to solve this problem by building ‚ú®AOT PAYMENTS‚ú®</br>
<p>
  
</p>
<p>### üí°WHAT PROBLEM DOES OUR PROJECT SOLVE?
<br>- <b>CONVENIENCE<b> : Traditional methods of fee payment often require physical presence, either at the institution's office or at a bank. Our project the AOT  fees payment app allows users to pay their fees from anywhere, at any time, using their smartphones or computers.</br>
<br>- ACCESSIBILITY :     The student has to login with his/her AOT Mail ID and password . Thus this reduces the effort to memorize multiple passwords
<br>- VARIOUS MODES OF TRANSACTION : Payment in AOT PAYMENTS can be done using NETBANKING , CARD TRANSACTIONS or  UPI .
<br>- TIME EFFICIENCY : With traditional methods, students and parents may have to wait in long queues to pay fees. Online payment eliminates the need for such time-consuming processes, making fee payment quick and hassle-free.
<br>- REDUCED ADMINISTRATIVE BURDEN : AOT typically spend a significant amount of time and resources managing and processing fee payments manually. An online payment system automates the process, reducing the administrative workload and the chances of errors.
<br>-  CASHLESS TRANSACTIONS : Online payment reduces the need for cash transactions, which can be inconvenient and pose security risks. This is especially important in today's increasingly digital and cashless economy.
<br>- PAYMENT SECURITY : Our team has tried its level best to ensure safe and secure transaqctions.</p>

  <p>### üôåOVERVIEW
<br>- In the LOGIN PAGE , the user needs to login with his/her AOT MAIL ID & Password.

<br>-  Lastly , we have listed our contact details in case of any need.

<p>### üíÄ CHALLENGES FACED:
 <br> - Since we are very new to Web Development , we feel like we could have worked more on the backend part.</br>
  <br>  - We found it difficult to introduce a CONFIRMATION EMAIL feature.</br>
   <br> - Our team will be working on this project further to improve its security</br>
 
</p>

<p>### üîÆ WHAT'S NEXT:
- Addition of NOTIFICATIONS & REMINDERS to update users on upcoming payment deadlines.
- Introduction of CONFIRMATION EMAIL feature along with PAYMENT RECEIPT using smtpJS for increasing <i>transparency</i>
- Introduction of TOKENISATION technology such as OTPs via SMS to increase security.</p>
